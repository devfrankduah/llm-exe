## ReAct with Actions (tools)

In this example, we will create a series of LLM executor functions which will work together to think step-by-step to decide which action to take to ultimately come up with the correct answer to an input question. The functions will use an internal dialogue combined with gtp-3.5-turbo.

Steps Overview
- **Define actions**. llm-exe does not provide pre-built tools or actions, but does provide a way to make any regular javascript function callable. For this example, we will need the ability to perform a Google search via an api, and also a function that calculates basic expressions.
- **Create LLM Executor**. Configure a prompt and LLM executor that is directed to think step by step through the question to decide the next action to take. We direct the LLM to respond with a thought/action/input and use an output parser to transform to JSON.
- **Write a loop** that will call our LLM executor to decide the next action and pass the result to another function to run the action. This continues until the final answer is reached (or max iterations is hit).

Note this is a basic example, and should be improved for error handling, etc.

#### Step 1 - Define Search Action
To allow our LLM to be able to search the internet, we'll need to define a callable function. You can use whatever search API configuration you'd like.

Note that `searchInternetCallable` is the configuration object that makes `searchGoogleApi` callable. Nothing really fancy going on.

<<< ../../examples/actions/search.ts

#### Step 2 - Define Calculator Action
To allow our LLM to be able to perform advanced calculations, we'll need to define a callable function. You can use whatever calculation library you'd like.

<<< ../../examples/actions/calculator.ts

#### Step 3 - Define Final Answer Action
We need to define a final answer action, but in this example we won't be doing anything with it, so we'll just pass through the input.

<<< ../../examples/actions/finalAnswer.ts


#### Step 4 - Configure Thought/Action/Input LLM executor
Configure a prompt and LLM executor that is directed to think step by step through the question to decide the next action to take.
@[code{15-67} ts](../../examples/_testing/react.ts)


#### Step 5 - Write Some Code
We'll write a simple loop that brings the previous steps together.
@[code{70-200} ts](../../examples/_testing/react.ts)


#### Example Output
```typescript
import { useSearchAndCalculatorReact } from "previous-example"


const input = `How much money did Roope Hintz make in 2023? What is that number multiplied by 12.25?`;

const { result } = await useSearchAndCalculatorReact(input);

/**
 * console.log(result)
 * 
 * "Roope Hintz made $11,500,000 in 2023. Multiplying this by 12.25
 * gives us a total of $140,875,000."
 * 
 */

```

Let's see how it got there:
