**Prompts**

**Chains**
Chains in langchain are similar to a combination of LLM executors.


**Agents**
Agents in langchain are like LLM functions in llm-exe. We broke the pieces out a little more.

See:

**Memory**
Memory in langchain is most comparable to state in llm-exe. State allows a simple interface to save the history of multiple dialogues, in addition to any other custom session properties.
