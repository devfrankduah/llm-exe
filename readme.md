A package that provides simplified base components to make building and maintaining LLM-powered applications easier.

- Write functions powered by LLM's with easy to use building blocks.
- Pure Javascript and Typescript. Allows you to pass and infer types.
- Support for text-based and chat-based prompts (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4).
- Supercharge your prompts by using handlebars within prompt template.
- Allow LLM's to call functions (or call other LLM executors).
- Not very opinionated. You have control on how you use it.
